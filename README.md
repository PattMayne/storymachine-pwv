**STORY MACHINE**

Software for writing story outlines. This is specifically about visualizing value changes, something that I haven't seen in other story plotting apps. You can outline beats, within scenes, within chapters, within acts, within each story. But the beat objects are connected to value-change objects, which themselves track the fortunes of a character by some value.
