**STORY MACHINE**

Software for writing story outlines. This is specifically about visualizing value changes, something that I haven't seen in other story plotting apps. You can outline beats, within scenes, within chapters, within acts, within each story. But the beat objects are connected to value-change objects, which themselves track the fortunes of a character by some value.


**TO DO:**

* CARDS SCREENS:
* Magnitude has limits
* Incorporate undo functionality in the text inputs.
* * May have to save content in a collection every time the content changes.
* * * Detect ctl-z and access version history
* "Archive Story" button
* * Add "archived" field to "story" schema


INIT PAGE:
* "View archives" button


* GRAPH SCREEN:
* Create new page
* load story
* load level
* display graphs
* Change levels
* Create new objects (beats, values, value changes, etc) with modals on the screen.
* Edit components with modals on the screen
* Reloading at that point will be MUCH easier than the cards screen.

* Load python data more smoothly on cards page
* Load python data more smoothly on edit page
* Load python data more smoothly on graph page

* Create a write-up / help / explanation document
* * Include advice such as "always rename your new components to something descriptive"
* * * "The automatic name includes its database ID to make it unique, but it should be renamed to something meaningful."
* remove "author" table
* * turn "author" field into a text field ("authors")
